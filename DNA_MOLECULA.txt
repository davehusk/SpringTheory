              [0, 0, 1, 0]])

# Define the degree matrix
D = np.diag(np.sum(A, axis=1))

# Define the Laplacian matrix

# Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(L)

# Calculate the inverse adjacency matrix if it's invertible
try:
    A_inv = np.linalg.inv(A)
except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
