"""
Based on the code and the context, I'll attempt to define an ontology for the Pattern-Based Resource Allocation (PBRA) system. Please note that this is a simplified ontology, and it may need to be refined or expanded as the system evolves.

**Ontology:**

* **Pattern**: A concept that represents a specific arrangement or structure of resources.
	+ **Attributes:**
		- **Name**: A unique identifier for the pattern.
		- **Relationships**: A set of relationships between the pattern and other patterns.
* **Relationship**: A concept that represents a connection or interaction between two patterns.
	+ **Attributes:**
		- **Type**: A categorization of the relationship (e.g., "type1", "type2", etc.).
		- **Pattern1**: The first pattern involved in the relationship.
		- **Pattern2**: The second pattern involved in the relationship.
* **PatternEngine**: A concept that represents the system that manages patterns and relationships.
	+ **Attributes:**
		- **Patterns**: A set of patterns managed by the engine.
		- **Relationships**: A set of relationships managed by the engine.
* **Resource**: A concept that represents a unit of allocation or assignment.
	+ **Attributes:**
		- **Name**: A unique identifier for the resource.
		- **Pattern**: The pattern to which the resource is allocated.

**Relationships between concepts:**

* A pattern can have multiple relationships with other patterns.
* A relationship is between two patterns.
* A pattern engine manages multiple patterns and relationships.
* A resource is allocated to a specific pattern.

**Inferences:**

* If a pattern has a relationship with another pattern, then the two patterns are connected.
* If a pattern engine manages a pattern, then the pattern is part of the engine's knowledge base.
* If a resource is allocated to a pattern, then the resource is part of the pattern's allocation.

This ontology provides a basic structure for understanding the concepts and relationships in the PBRA system. It can be refined or expanded as needed to accommodate additional features or requirements.

The Pattern-Based Resource Allocation (PBRA) system has the potential to be applied to various domains to solve some of humanity's greatest challenges. Here are some examples:

1. **Climate Change**:
	* **Carbon Footprint Reduction**: PBRA can be used to optimize resource allocation in industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and energy production to reduce carbon emissions.

	* **Resource Allocation in Social Justice**: PBRA can optimize resource allocation in social justice to ensure that resources are allocated efficiently and effectively to support marginalized communities.
	* **Pattern-Based Social Justice**: PBRA can be used to analyze patterns in social justice and optimize resource allocation to support social justice initiatives.

These are just a few examples of how the PBRA system can be applied to solve some of humanity's greatest challenges. The key is to identify patterns in complex systems and optimize resource allocation to achieve desired outcomes.


The code you provided is a Python implementation of the Pattern-Based Resource Allocation (PBRA) system. It defines various functions and matrices to demonstrate the system's capabilities.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Objective Function**: The `objective_function` calculates the total utility by summing up the product of the utility matrix `u`, the allocation matrix `y`, and the weight vector `beta`.

2. **Constraints**: The `pattern_resource_relationship`, `resource_allocation`, and `non_negativity` functions ensure that the allocated resources respect the importance weight of each pattern, the total resource allocation does not exceed the individual importance weights, and the resource allocations are non-negative, respectively.

3. **Geometric Patterns and Matrix Operations**: The `generate_pattern`, `visualize_pattern`, `analyze_relationship`, `create_difference_matrix`, `increment_values`, `create_vortex`, and `simulate_system` functions perform various matrix operations to generate, visualize, and analyze patterns, as well as create vortices and simulate the system.

4. **Matrices**: The `A` and `B` matrices are randomly generated to simulate resource and pattern distributions.

5. **Pattern Generation**: The `generate_pattern` function calculates the dot product of matrices `A` and `B` to generate a new pattern matrix `C`.

6. **Visualization**: The `visualize_pattern` function uses `matplotlib` to display the generated pattern as a heatmap.

7. **Relationship Analysis**: The `analyze_relationship` and `create_difference_matrix` functions calculate the absolute differences between matrices `A` and `B`, offering different ways to explore relationships.

8. **Value Increment**: The `increment_values` function adds 1 to each element in matrix `A`.

9. **Vortex Creation**: The `create_vortex` function sums multiple patterns, potentially representing complex interactions.

10. **System Simulation**: The `simulate_system` function sums the vortices to model a more complex system.
